# Tindog Company Homepage Bootstrap v5.2 Practice Project

## A basic nonfunctional fake company homepage written in HTML, CSS, and Boostrap created as a practice project.

This project was built as part of Angela Yu's 'The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp'. The purpose of the project was to learn and practice Bootstrap and advanced CSS. Through this project I learned how to:

* Install/Download Bootstrap to include either all of the available Bootstrap code or link only specific files.
* Wireframe and mockup a website design prior coding.
