# Tindog Company Homepage Bootstrap v5.2 Practice Project

## A basic nonfunctional fake company homepage written in HTML, CSS, and Boostrap created as a practice project.

This project was built as part of Angela Yu's 'The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp'. The purpose of the project was to learn and practice Bootstrap and advanced CSS. Through this project I learned how to:

* Install/Download Bootstrap to include either all of the available Bootstrap code or link only specific files.
* Wireframe and mockup a website design prior coding.
* Creating a navbar with Bootstrap (i.e. creating nav items and links), making it flexible to appear horizontal on web and vertical on mobile, styling the items, and condensing the navbar into a hamburger on smaller screens. 
* Implement the Bootstrap grid to create rows and columns and make the grid flexible to adjust how many items appear within each based on screen size (i.e. 2 items per row on mobile and 4 items per row on desktop).
* Wrap sections using the container and container-fluid classes to auto adjust the size of items within the container based on screen size.
* Activate script from www.fontawesome.com to include icons on a webpage using Bootstrap.
* Add a Boostrap Carousel (including how to adjust the interval time, make the carousel react to keyboard strokes, pause the carousel when hovering over it with a mouse, autoplay after user cycles through the first item, make carousel stop after a cetain number of cycles). Also how to add items within the carousel and vistual buttons. 
* Create Bootstrap cards and adjust the size of each card, how many cards are contained within each row and column, and the size of the gaps between each card.
* Use Z-Index to adjust which items are behind or in front on the webpage.
* Add media queries to adjust items on the screen based on specific screen size breakpoints.
* Refactor my code for readability, modularity, efficiency, and length.
* Use hierarchial and combined selectors to reduce number of classes being used and make code more readable.
